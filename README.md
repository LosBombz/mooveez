Carlos,

Below is the exercise the team would like you to work on and return to us by Monday, 11/10.  You should not spend more than about 6 hours of effort performing these tasks.  If you cannot complete all of the stories in the project scope, we will evaluate based on what you have completed.  If you need any further direction, you can email Brian Sodano directly. Let me know if you have any questions.

Todd


#General Requirements:

Implement the stories described below. The purpose is to evaluate the developer in terms of their ability to learn and implement the required technologies, which are:

 *   JavaScript
 *   EmberJS MVC framework – creating a single page web app
 *   Required HTML markup (HTML5 is fine)
 *   SCSS (plain CSS is also acceptable)
 *   Appropriate unit tests

Any other technology may be added to the list to implement the stories.

Results will be evaluated on the following:

 *   Story implementation
 *   Best practices and code structure
 *   Testing

Stories to implement (Project Scope):
Note: The page should not reload to accomplish any of these tasks.

 1.  As an end-user I want to see a table of movies via a specific search term from [myapifilms](http://www.myapifilms.com) [OMDb](http://www.omdbapi.com/) (against IMDB) with the following columns:
    *   Title
    *   Release Date
    *   Director or list of Directors
 
 2.  As an end-user I want to click on a row and see a new application view with the movie details (same data as in initial page view for that record plus Genre and Runtime – feel free to add additional fields if you want to display them).
 
 3.  As an end-user I want a button that can transfer me back from movie details page to the original table.
 
 4.  As an end-user I want to be see no more than 20 movies on the screen and use pagination to navigate between displayed pages.
 
 5.  As an end-user I want to filter my results by any column.
 
 6.  As an end-user I should be able to sort every column.
